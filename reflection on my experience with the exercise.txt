Dear Team,

I am writing to provide an overview of my experience with the CSM, Digital Success 2024 (Global) Take-Home Exercise for Vercel. This exercise presented several challenges that highlighted areas for my professional growth and learning.

The exercise required creating a Next.js application using the App Router feature, which was a significant departure from my usual approach of building static websites with HTML and CSS. This requirement exposed a gap in my current skill set, as I am more comfortable with direct HTML/CSS development rather than using modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js.

The task felt particularly challenging due to several factors:

1. New concepts: The exercise introduced multiple new technologies and concepts, including Next.js, Vercel, and the App Router, which required a substantial time investment to understand and implement effectively.
2. Shift in development paradigm: Moving from static HTML/CSS to a React-based framework like Next.js necessitated a fundamental change in how I approach web application structure and development.

Despite these challenges, I recognize the importance of adapting to new technologies in the rapidly evolving field of web development. The exercise has made it clear that to excel in a Customer Success Manager role at Vercel, I need to enhance my skills in modern web development frameworks and platforms.

The exercise also emphasized the importance of problem-solving, communication, and understanding one's role in Customer Success. While I may not have been able to fully implement the technical aspects of the project, I believe my ability to explain my thought process and identify areas where I need additional knowledge aligns well with the exercise's goals.

Moving forward, I plan to focus on the following areas to improve my candidacy for this position:

1. Gain practical experience with Next.js and the App Router feature
2. Familiarize myself with Vercel's platform and deployment processes
3. Enhance my understanding of modern web development workflows, particularly the transition from static sites to dynamic, framework-based applications

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this exercise, as it has provided valuable insights into the skills required for success in this role. I am committed to addressing these learning areas and would welcome any additional resources or guidance the team could provide to support my professional development in these areas.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Vercel's Customer Success team as I continue to grow my technical skills
